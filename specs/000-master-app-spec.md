## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a digital nomad planning to live in Thailand, I want a comprehensive platform that guides me through income generation, visa processes, accommodation options, and learning opportunities so that I can successfully transition to a Thailand-based digital nomad lifestyle.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am a new visitor, **When** I land on the homepage, **Then** I see the value proposition and can explore the roadmap
2. **Given** I am a free user, **When** I access the roadmap, **Then** I can see all phases but have limited access to premium content
3. **Given** I am a paid user, **When** I access any feature, **Then** I have full access to all content and functionality
4. **Given** I am learning about income opportunities, **When** I complete a course, **Then** my progress is tracked and I earn XP
5. **Given** I need visa information, **When** I search for visa types, **Then** I get detailed, Thailand-specific visa guidance

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to access premium content without proper access?
