## Dependencies

### Critical Path Dependencies
- T001-T006 must complete before any other tasks (project setup)
- T007-T012 must complete before feature development (base architecture)
- T019-T024 must complete before access control features (user system)
- T030-T035 must complete before course-specific features (learning platform)

### Feature Dependencies
- Learning Platform (T030-T045) can run parallel with Income Generation (T046-T055)
- Visa Information (T056-T065) can run parallel with Accommodation (T066-T080)
- Roadmap Navigation (T081-T090) depends on all feature implementations
- User Profile (T091-T100) depends on all feature implementations

### Testing Dependencies
- All feature implementations must complete before testing phases
- Unit tests (T101-T105) can run parallel with integration tests (T106-T110)
- E2E tests (T111-T115) must run after all features are complete

## Parallel Execution Examples

### Phase 1 Parallel Tasks
```
# Run T001-T006 together (project setup):
Task: "Initialize TypeScript configuration with strict mode"
Task: "Configure Vite build system with React and TypeScript"
Task: "Set up Tailwind CSS with custom frosted glass theme"
Task: "Configure ESLint and Prettier for code quality"
Task: "Set up Jest and React Testing Library for testing"

```

### Phase 3 Parallel Tasks
```
# Run T036-T040 together (Amazon FBA course):

Task: "Create lesson components for video, quiz, and homework"
Task: "Implement course navigation and progress tracking"
Task: "Create mentor profile and contact system"
Task: "Implement course completion certificates"
```

## Notes

- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task completion
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts
- All tasks must follow TDD approach
- Mobile-first design required for all UI tasks
- Thailand-specific content required for all content tasks

## Validation Checklist
- [ ] All features have corresponding implementation tasks
- [ ] All tasks specify exact file paths
- [ ] Parallel tasks truly independent
- [ ] Dependencies clearly defined
- [ ] Testing tasks cover all functionality
- [ ] Performance optimization included
- [ ] Mobile optimization prioritized
