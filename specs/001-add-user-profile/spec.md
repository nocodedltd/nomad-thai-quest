# Feature Specification: Add User Profile Picture Upload

**Feature Branch**: `001-add-user-profile`  
**Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Add user profile picture upload feature"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to upload a profile picture so that I can personalize my account and make it easier for others to identify me.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am logged in, **When** I click "Upload Profile Picture", **Then** I can select and upload an image file
2. **Given** I have uploaded a profile picture, **When** I view my profile, **Then** I see my uploaded picture displayed
3. **Given** I want to change my profile picture, **When** I upload a new image, **Then** the old picture is replaced with the new one

### Edge Cases
- What happens when I try to upload a file that's too large?
- How does the system handle unsupported file formats?
- What if the upload fails due to network issues?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to upload image files as profile pictures
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate uploaded files are supported image formats (JPEG, PNG, WebP)
- **FR-003**: System MUST resize uploaded images to standard profile picture dimensions
- **FR-004**: System MUST store profile pictures securely and associate them with user accounts
- **FR-005**: System MUST display profile pictures in user interfaces where appropriate
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow users to remove their profile picture
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle file size limits and show appropriate error messages
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide a default placeholder when no profile picture is set

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **UserProfile**: Contains user information including profile picture URL and metadata
- **ProfilePicture**: Represents the uploaded image file with properties like filename, size, format, and storage location
