# Feature Specification: Roadmap Navigation System

**Feature Branch**: `005-roadmap-navigation-spec`  
**Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Complete  
**Input**: Visual roadmap and navigation system for Thailand digital nomad journey

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a digital nomad planning my Thailand journey, I want a visual roadmap that guides me through the process so that I can understand what steps to take and track my progress.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am new to the platform, **When** I view the roadmap, **Then** I see all phases of the Thailand nomad journey
2. **Given** I am a free user, **When** I access the roadmap, **Then** I can see all phases but have limited access to premium content
3. **Given** I am a paid user, **When** I access the roadmap, **Then** I have full access to all phases and content
4. **Given** I complete a phase, **When** I mark it complete, **Then** my progress is updated and I unlock the next phase
5. **Given** I want to focus on a specific area, **When** I click on a phase, **Then** I am taken to the relevant section

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to access locked phases without proper access?
- How does the system handle users who complete phases out of order?
- What if a user's access level changes while they're in the middle of a phase?
- How does the system handle users with different starting points or backgrounds?
