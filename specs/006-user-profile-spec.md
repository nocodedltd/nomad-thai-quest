## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a user of the platform, I want to manage my profile information and track my progress so that I can see my achievements and continue my Thailand nomad journey effectively.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am a new user, **When** I create my profile, **Then** I can enter my personal information and preferences
2. **Given** I am using the platform, **When** I complete activities, **Then** my progress is automatically tracked and updated
3. **Given** I want to see my achievements, **When** I view my profile, **Then** I can see my XP, badges, and completed milestones
4. **Given** I want to update my information, **When** I edit my profile, **Then** my changes are saved and reflected across the platform
